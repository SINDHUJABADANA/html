There are many types of education.<b> Formal education</b> happens in a complex institutional framework, like public schools. <i>Non-formal education is also structured but happens outside the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences.</i><em> Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels.</em><small><u> They include early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education.</u></small><big> Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education.</big><del> Forms of education can also be distinguished by subject, like science education, language education, and physical education.</del>

<bdo>Education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society.</bdo><strong> This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies.</strong> They determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend. International organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children.
